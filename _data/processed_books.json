Whether you're encrypting or decrypting ciphers, a solid background in number theory is essential for success. Written by a number theorist and practicing cryptographer, Cryptanalysis of Number Theoretic Ciphers takes you from basic number theory to the inner workings of ciphers and protocols.      First, the book provides the mathematical background needed in cryptography as well as definitions and simple examples from cryptography. It includes summaries of elementary number theory and group theory, as well as common methods of finding or constructing large random primes, factoring large integers, and computing discrete logarithms. Next, it describes a selection of cryptographic algorithms, most of which use number theory. Finally, the book presents methods of attack on the cryptographic algorithms and assesses their effectiveness. For each attack method the author lists the systems it applies to and tells how they may be broken with it.      Computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems. Cryptanalysis of Number Theoretic Ciphers builds a solid foundation in number theory and shows you how to apply it not only when breaking ciphers, but also when designing ones that are difficult to break.","reviews":"","subject":"Combinatorics & graph theory, Mathematical logic, Discrete mathematics, MATHEMATICS / Combinatorics, COMPUTERS / Security / General, COMPUTERS / Operating Systems / General, Science & Mathematics: Textbooks & Study Guides, Mathematics, Combinatorics & graph theory, Mathematical logic, Discrete mathematics","series":"Computational Mathematics","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Aug 30, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190830","page_count":null,"usd_price":"57.95","gbp_price":"41.99","format":"Digital"},{"title":"Water, Sustainable Development and the Nexus","isbn":"9781498786522","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1498786529","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498786529","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1498786529","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1498786529","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1498786529","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1498786529","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1498786529","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1498786529","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1498786529","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1498786529","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781498786522","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781498786522","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781498786522","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781498786522&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781498786522&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781498786522","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781498786522","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781498786522&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781498786522&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781498786522","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781498786522","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781498786522","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781498786522","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781498786522","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781498786522","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781498786522;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"Response to Climate Change","image_path":"9781498786522.jpg","author":"Velma I.

These provide motivation for the subsequent detailed treatment of more up-to-date investigations which have led to significant theoretical developments on topics such as solvability and the long-term behaviour of solutions.

Early Astronomers Royal gathered astronomical data with the purpose of enabling navigators to compute their longitude at sea.  Nevil Maskelyne in the 18th century   organised the work of computing tables for the Nautical Almanac, anticipating later methods used in safety-critical computing systems. The 19th century saw influential critiques of Charles Babbage's mechanical calculating engines, and in the 20th century Leslie Comrie and others pioneered the automation of computation.  The arrival of the Royal Naval College in 1873 and the University of Greenwich in 1999 has brought more mathematicians and different kinds of mathematics to Greenwich.  In the 21st century computational mathematics has found many new applications.

I am delighted that<i>   </i>  this has inspired the present volume, <i>  Mathematics at the Meridian: The History of Mathematics at Greenwich</i>  , that features many of the same eminent contributors.  \n    \n   Greenwich has a unique status in Britain, rightly recognised as a World Heritage Site: a centre for shipping and navigation, astronomy and education, and an architectural treasure. This book comprehensively explores the important role of mathematics in its long history. From John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal at the 'King's Observatory' who compiled reliable astronomical tables, to his successors, Nevil Maskelyne and George Biddell Airy, there was strong emphasis on accurate computation alongside precise observations. In more recent times, L.J. Comrie oversaw the mechanical production of mathematical tables.  \n   The Greenwich Royal Hospital School and Greenwich Naval College educated the youth, and several professors did notable research, particularly Thomas Archer Hirst and William Burnside. \n    \n   In its twelve chapters, this book gives a comprehensive, scholarly and readable overview of Greenwich and its mathematical, astronomical and computational achievements. As a bonus, it is attractively illustrated with numerous portraits and other images.\" \n    \n   <strong>  - Emeritus Professor Alexander Craik, University of St Andrews</strong>   \n    \n   From the building of the Royal Observatory in the 1670s, to the 21st century mathematics department at the University, <i>  Mathematics at the Meridian: The History of Mathematics at Greenwich</i>   shows that Greenwich has a long, varied and important mathematical history. It is a history which, amongst other things, encompasses the longitude problem, calculating machines and mathematical instruments, and major figures including John Flamsteed, George Biddell Airy, Thomas Archer Hirst and William Burnside.  \n    \n   Raymond Flood, Tony Mann and Mary Coarken have brought together a group of authors who are both experts in their fields and excellent communicators to produce a wonderful edited volume.

I have used earlier editions repeatedly in data-analysis courses for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in applied fields.  The level of mathematical presentation is well matched to such settings.  Not only are there excellent examples from biostatistics and public health, but there are also some very good business financial examples. The new chapter on Data Visualization in the new, sixth  edition will be especially useful. Overall, the book is exceptionally well written and readable.\"   - <strong>  Stanley Sclove</strong>  , University of Illinois at Chicago \n   \"Editions of Practical Multivariate Analysis have been the mainstay of my graduate-level service course in applied data-analysis since 1985.  It remains an extraordinary book -- packed with excellent examples, clear explanation and fine advice -- and has my highest possible recommendation.  Among many reasons it remains so extraordinary, are three signaled directly in its title:  it is practical rather than theoretical, analytic rather than technical, and it embodies a broader-than-usual conception of utilitarian multivariate methods.     Practical Multivariate Analysis connects readily to its audience's reality.  It uses concrete research questions and real data to motivate its content, illustrated by exemplary analyses using R, SAS, SPSS and STATA.  It models how complex findings can be made comprehensible to a broader community.     It reaches beyond the typical spectrum of multivariate methods.  It begins sensibly, discussing how multivariate data can be explored and displayed before complex analysis.  Then come chapters on useful extensions to multiple regression analysis.  While not usually considered \"multivariate,\" these latter methods connect an incoming audience to earlier acquired skills and extend them.  Then follow the core chapters on \"standard\" multivariate methods, including canonical correlation, discriminant, principal-components, factor and cluster analyses.  All are clearly presented, and then extended by excellent chapters on logistic regression, survival and log-linear analyses, and multilevel modeling, techniques that have proven useful and ubiquitous throughout social-science research.   In my view, Practical Multivariate Analysis is an excellent roadmap for conducting such analyses, and a fine model for ensuring that their complex findings can be communicated successfully to others.\"   - <strong>  John B. Willett</strong>  ,<strong>   </strong>  Charles William Eliot Research Professor, Harvard University Graduate School of Education \n   \"The Practical Multivariate Analysis is a fun statistical modeling book to read. I enjoyed the rich   insights the book has provided, which can only be accumulated through years of experience with   the complexity in real data. It covers a large collection of statistical methods and models with a   clear focus on application. Always discussing a model or method along with data examples, the   book helps readers focus on important perspectives in applying the model, from choice of   appropriate methods to interpretation of the results, while it still manages to maintain the   technique details at a minimal level.   Readers with different backgrounds can all benefit from this book. It is valuable for researchers   who are interested in analyzing their data with classical statistical models and interpreting the   results. It is a good reading for new graduates in statistics who have not had a lot of experience   with real data as the book provides many importance guidance in handling real data as well as   watch-out advices. It can be used by applied data scientists and serve as a resourceful reference   book for experienced consultants.\"   - <strong>  Xia Wang</strong>  , University of Cincinnati   ","subject":"Probability & statistics, Psychological methodology, MATHEMATICS / Probability & Statistics / General, Science & Mathematics: Textbooks & Study Guides, Mathematics, Probability & statistics, Psychological methodology","series":"Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Oct 16, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20191016","page_count":null,"usd_price":"99.95","gbp_price":"74.99","format":"Digital"},{"title":"The Histology of Fishes","isbn":"9781498784481","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1498784488","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498784488","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1498784488","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1498784488","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1498784488","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1498784488","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1498784488","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1498784488","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1498784488","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1498784488","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781498784481","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781498784481","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781498784481","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781498784481&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781498784481&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781498784481","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781498784481","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781498784481&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781498784481&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781498784481","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781498784481","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781498784481","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781498784481","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781498784481","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781498784481","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781498784481;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781498784481.jpg","author":"Krzysztof Formicki and Frank Kirschbaum","blurb":"   The book is a multi-authored book of 18 chapters comprising the state of the art work of all relevant topics on modern fish histology from 28 authors from ten countries.

Through illustrative data analysis and attention to statistical computing, this book facilitates practical implementation of Bayesian hierarchical methods. \n    \n   The new edition is a revision of the book <i>  Applied Bayesian Hierarchical Methods</i>  . It maintains a focus on applied modelling and data analysis, but now using entirely R-based Bayesian computing options. It has been updated with a new chapter on regression for causal effects, and one on computing options and strategies. This latter chapter is particularly important, due to recent advances in Bayesian computing and estimation, including the development of rjags and rstan. It also features updates throughout with new examples. \n    \n   The examples exploit and illustrate the broader advantages of the R computing environment, while allowing readers to explore alternative likelihood assumptions, regression structures, and assumptions on prior densities. \n    \n   Features: \n       \n         Provides a comprehensive and accessible overview of applied Bayesian hierarchical modelling          \n \n         Includes many real data examples to illustrate different modelling topics          \n \n         R code (based on rjags, jagsUI, R2OpenBUGS, and rstan) is integrated into the book, emphasizing implementation          \n \n         Software options and coding principles are introduced in new chapter on computing          \n \n         Programs and data sets available on the book's website                \n      ","reviews":"","subject":"Probability & statistics, Probability & statistics, Biology, life sciences, MATHEMATICS / Probability & Statistics / General, Science & Mathematics: Textbooks & Study Guides, Mathematics, Probability & statistics","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Sep 16, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190916","page_count":null,"usd_price":"129.95","gbp_price":"96.99","format":"Digital"},{"title":"Simpson's Forensic Medicine, 14th Edition","isbn":"9781498704380","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1498704387","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498704387","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1498704387","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1498704387","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1498704387","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1498704387","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1498704387","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1498704387","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1498704387","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1498704387","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781498704380","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781498704380","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781498704380","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781498704380&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781498704380&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781498704380","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781498704380","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781498704380&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781498704380&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781498704380","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781498704380","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781498704380","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781498704380","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781498704380","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781498704380","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781498704380;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781498704380.jpg","author":"Jason Payne-James and Richard Martin Jones","blurb":"Prestigious and authoritative, this fully updated fourteenth edition of Simpson's Forensic Medicine remains a classic; one of the world's leading introductory texts in the field of forensic medicine.

Its use is less mature in geotechnical design, but there is a steady progression towards reliability-based design as seen in the inclusion of a new Annex D on \"Reliability of Geotechnical Structures\" in the third edition of ISO 2394. Reliability-based design can be viewed as a simplified form of risk-based design where different consequences of failure are implicitly covered by the adoption of different target reliability indices. Explicit risk management methodologies are required for large geotechnical systems where soil and loading conditions are too varied to be conveniently slotted into a few reliability classes (typically three) and an associated simple discrete tier of target reliability indices.

The interdisciplinary nature of this book makes it an excellent resource for scholars and practitioners of GIS, policymaking, urban planning, and public and nonprofit management.\"   <strong>  Meghna Sabharwal</strong>  , <em>  The University of Texas at Dallas, USA</em>  </b>     ","subject":"Geographical information systems (GIS) & remote sensing, Public administration, Human geography, Peace studies & conflict resolution, MEDICAL / Public Health, TECHNOLOGY & ENGINEERING / Remote Sensing & Geographic Information Systems, SOCIAL SCIENCE / Disasters & Disaster Relief, Geography & Earth Science: Textbooks & Study Guides, Geography, Geographical information systems & remote sensing, Public administration, Human geography, Peace studies & conflict resolution","series":null,"series_number":null,"pub_date":"Sep 11, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190911","page_count":null,"usd_price":"89.95","gbp_price":"57.99","format":"Digital"},{"title":"A Concise Introduction to Machine Learning","isbn":"9781351204729","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1351204726","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1351204726","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1351204726","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1351204726","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1351204726","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1351204726","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1351204726","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1351204726","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1351204726","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1351204726","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781351204729","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781351204729","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781351204729","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781351204729&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781351204729&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781351204729","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781351204729","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781351204729&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781351204729&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781351204729","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781351204729","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781351204729","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781351204729","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781351204729","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781351204729","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781351204729;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781351204729.jpg","author":"A.C.

Still, the book collects vast, up-to-date information for many counting sequences (especially, related to set partitions and permutations), so it is a must-have piece for those mathematicians who do research on enumerative combinatorics. \n   In addition, the book contains number theoretical results on counting sequences of set partitions and permutations, so number theorists who would like to see nice applications of their area of interest in combinatorics will enjoy the book, too.   <b>\n</b>     <b>  Features</b>   \n       \n         <b>  The Outlook sections at the end of each chapter guide the reader towards topics not covered in the book, and many of the Outlook items point towards new research problems.</b>            \n \n         <b>  An extensive bibliography and tables at the end make the book usable as a standard reference.</b>            \n \n         <b>  Citations to results which were scattered in the literature now become easy, because huge parts of the book (especially in parts II and III) appear in book form for the first time.</b>                  \n      ","reviews":"","subject":"Combinatorics & graph theory, Mathematical logic, Number theory, COMPUTERS / Security / Cryptography, MATHEMATICS / General, MATHEMATICS / Number Theory, MATHEMATICS / Combinatorics, Science & Mathematics: Textbooks & Study Guides, Mathematics, Combinatorics & graph theory, Mathematical logic, Number theory","series":"Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications","series_number":null,"pub_date":"Aug 19, 2019","pub_date_iso":"20190819","page_count":null,"usd_price":"57.95","gbp_price":"41.99","format":"Digital"},{"title":"Technical Proceedings of the 2007 Cleantech Conference and Trade Show","isbn":"9781498721837","amz_uk_url":"http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1498721834","amz_us_url":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1498721834","amz_ca_url":"http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1498721834","amz_de_url":"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1498721834","amz_br_url":"http://www.amazon.com.br/gp/product/1498721834","amz_mx_url":"http://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/product/1498721834","amz_fr_url":"http://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/1498721834","amz_es_url":"http://www.amazon.es/gp/product/1498721834","amz_jp_url":"http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/1498721834","amz_in_url":"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/1498721834","kobo_url":"https://store.kobobooks.com/search?Query=9781498721837","infini-beam_url":"http://www.infibeam.com/search?q=9781498721837","google_play_url":"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781498721837","hive_url":"http://www.hive.co.uk/Search/Keyword?keyword=9781498721837&productType=0","booktopia_url":"http://www.booktopia.com.au/search.ep?keywords=9781498721837&productType=917504","barnes_and_noble_url":"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/9781498721837","worldcat_url":"http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=9781498721837","books_a_million_url":"http://www.booksamillion.com/search?query=9781498721837&where=All","book_finder_url":"http://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=&title=&lang=en&isbn=9781498721837&new=1&used=1&ebooks=1&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr","wordery_url":"https://wordery.com/search?term=9781498721837","waterstones_url":"https://www.waterstones.com/index/search/?term=9781498721837","foyles_url":"http://www.foyles.co.uk/all?term=9781498721837","book_depository_url":"http://www.bookdepository.com/book/9781498721837","wh_smith_url":"http://www.whsmith.co.uk/search/go?af=&w=9781498721837","blackwells_url":"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/welcome.jsp?action=search&type=isbn&term=9781498721837","oxfam_url":"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/search-results?q=9781498721837;show_all=ogb_mixed","subtitle":"","image_path":"9781498721837.jpg","author":"NanoScience &amp;
